#  Prediction-of-activation-energy
Different machine learning algorithms from sciki-learn are compared. 
Two different types of fingerprint are compared. One is using the reactants and products as fngerprint.(Ea-NN-reactants). The other is using reaction type as a fingerprint(Ea-GP-reactiontype)
The orginal dataset is calculated by density functional theory in VASP.
